## Report Bug
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an mongo database.

Originally a simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.
Can be found on telegram as [rose bot](https://t.me/szrosebot).
I am moderating a support group, where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.  
Join the [news channel](https://t.me/szteambots) if you just want to stay in the loop about new features or announcements.
> ⚠️ Note: 
> We don't officially support forks / Clones for rose, So don't tag admins for errors your bot/deploy/code, If any error you should fix it yourself
