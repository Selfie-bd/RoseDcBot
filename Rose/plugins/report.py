__HELP__ = """
We're all busy people who don't have time to monitor our groups 24/7. 
But how do you react if someone in your group is spamming?
Presenting reports; if someone in your group thinks someone 
needs reporting, they now have an easy way to call all admins.

**User commands:**
- /report: Reply to a message to report it for admins to review.
- admin: Same as /report

**Admin commands:**
- /reports `<yes/no/on/off>`: Enable/disable user reports.
To report a user, simply reply to his message with @admin or /report;
Rose will then reply with a message stating that admins have been notified. 
This message tags all the chat admins; same as if they had been @'ed.
Note that the report commands do not work when admins use them; 
or when used to report an admin. Rose assumes that admins 
don't need to report, or be reported!
